                            <h3>Identity</h3>
                            <p>
                                I am an empathetic and socio-sensitive designer with a focus on emotional well-being. I’ve always been a soft and socially sensitive person. Even as a child, I was deeply affected by the world around me, watching the news or seeing others in distress impacted me. To use empathy effectively and avoid its pitfalls, I use it as a starting point and combine it with real user input [1]. In my design, I think about my user, the user experience and social impact. My instinct in every situation is to help people. This shapes my vision on design in the sense that I care a lot about my user and their (emotional) well-being. This is something that I understood better throughout my master's. By choosing projects that matched my values, I discovered that well-being and mental support during difficult times are what my projects have had in common. I recently worked within themes like mental support in times of stress and supporting love in couples that are challenged with dementia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My values have led to an interest in Social Design, User Centred Design [6] and Design Thinking [7]. In my process, I focus on what really matters to me: understanding the user and their daily reality. Interviews and testing are important to make sure the design truly fits their needs. Within the design process, my strength lies in working on going from a rough sketch to a real concept by trying to find out what a user or society really needs. One thing I still find challenging is making fast decisions when the pace is high. Even though the master focused on solo projects, I believe in the strength of teamwork. Collaborative sessions with other designers or multidisciplinary teams add valuable perspectives. But something that is central for all my design projects is the user.

                            <h3>Vision</h3>
                            <p>
                                I believe that design should make the world a better place. I aim to create designs that truly help; designs that make people feel seen and empowered, even in life’s difficult moments. I believe this can be done by designing for well-being, which focuses on increasing happiness and empowering users to lead full lives [2].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               My motivation also comes from personal experiences. Going through periods of stress and caring for family members with health issues showed me how overwhelming and all-consuming these can be. These experiences made me realise how important it is to design for themes that are emotional, personal, and sometimes even taboo. Even though designing for well-being can be complex [5], I believe that including these themes is very meaningful because, for the person experiencing the struggle, it can deeply impact their daily life. Design can support and empower them by strengthening their mental well-being. Examples that inspires me as a designer are chatbots like Vincent [3] and Diarybot [4] which work on well-being with small daily interventions that help users become more mentally resilient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am a designer who looks at what technology fits the situation best. I use technology because of its potential within a project use case, not just for the sake of using it. In my approach, empathy and emotional depth are important. I focus on the mental and social layers of a person’s life, especially in moments of vulnerability. I bring this vision to life in two ways: by choosing projects that focus on emotionally relevant topics, and by actively integrating mental and emotional aspects throughout the design process. For me, it's important that the user is placed at the centre, not only in terms of usability, but as a whole person with emotional needs and lived experiences. I combine insights from proven concepts and literature with the perspective of the user within my design process. My design impacts society in terms of well-being. I hope to contribute to a world where design helps people not just function but truly thrive.

                                    This is my strongest and favourite expertise area, as it closely connects to my PIV. <a href="#m2.1" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m2.1')">Courses at HTI</a> taught me to use theory to support users’ mental processes. During my master’s I was able to place the user at the centre of my design process (USD) while also critically analysing the broader societal impact of my wellbeing designs. Because of my <a href="#m1.2" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m1.1')">M1.2</a> (and FMP), I am experienced in conducting in-depth interviews in search of user needs and situated perspectives. In these sessions, I learned to use my empathic qualities to create a comfortable atmosphere and ask open-minded questions that encourage the sharing of deeply personal experiences. Combined with my MD&C skills, I can collect and analyse qualitative data to both ground and validate my designs, as demonstrated in my <a href="#fmp" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','fmp')">FMP</a>.

                                    B&E is the expertise area in which I have grown the most. Through applying Design Thinking and value-related models to a wide range of problem statements, both in assignments during my <a href="#part-time-job" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','part-time-job')">part-time job</a> and in B&E electives, I have learned to confidently create propositions for stakeholders based on envisioned value. By working with models such as the Business Model Canvas, Stakeholder Tension Mapping, and PESTEL analysis, I can critically analyse and strengthen my designs, making them more relevant and better prepared for real-world application, and thus more realistic in impacting users’ daily lives (U&S)  . An example of this is the business analysis I conducted during my <a href="#fmp" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','fmp')">FMP</a>, where I explored positioning, stakeholder value, and the broader system around my design.

                                    For me, this area is about building hands-on skills that enable me to independently create and test ideas. I am proficient in 3D modelling and rendering (SketchUp, Enscape, SolidWorks) and make use of 3D printing in my design process for mechanical construction, a skill I further developed through my <a href="#part-time-job" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','part-time-job')">part-time job</a>. In <a href="#m1.1" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m1.1')">M1.1</a>, I wrote Arduino code for connectivity and multiple actuators within prototypes. During my <a href="#fmp" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','fmp')">FMP</a>, I programmed an HTML website and integrated a conversational agent with JavaScript, which further strengthened my software and coding skills. While my programming knowledge is not yet deep, it enables me to quickly prototype interactive concepts.

                                    Throughout my studies, I have built a repertoire of creative techniques. But for me, creativity is not only about applying existing techniques but also about having the attitude  to create new ones. I apply my own creative techniques throughout my projects, for example, combining C&A with T&R by using 1st person perspective in combination with AI as a tool for ideation and fine-tuning in my <a href="#fmp" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','fmp')">FMP</a>. While I am not particularly strong in the graphics side of aesthetics, I am interested in aesthetics of interaction as it helps guide user behaviour. Through my  <a href="#m1.1" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m1.1')">M1.1</a>  I also used material-driven aesthetics of interaction as an idea generation technique.

                                 My skills within MD&C are overall limited, but one aspect I find especially valuable for my vision and design process is working with qualitative data. This directly supports one of my strongest U&S skills: conducting in-depth user evaluations. Through my master’s projects, I gained extensive experience in analysing interview and user test data. In <a href="#m1.1" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m1.1')">M1.1</a>, I worked with ATLAS.ti, after which I chose to focus more on lived experiences and searched for methods that aligned better with my vision. During <a href="#m1.2" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m1.2')">M1.2</a> and my <a href="#fmp" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','fmp')">FMP</a>, I developed the ability to conduct group coding sessions and perform thematic analyses, allowing me to ground my designs in rich user insights.

                                    The Social Progress Index[8] measures the success of a region based on social progress rather than economic performance. Entangled Conversations enriches this tool using personal storytelling, visualisation, and embodied activities to reveal individual perspectives and foster connections.

                                    <li>I learned to apply aesthetics of interaction in ideation by experimenting with interpersonal contact during bodystorming sessions using materials like balloons and rope. This showed me how aesthetics of interaction can be used not only as a design outcome but also as a creative brainstorming method (C&A). 
                                    </li>

                                    <li>I developed skills in building interactive prototypes by coding in Arduino and setting up circuits for four wearables with vibration motors and buttons. This strengthened my abilities in T&R and MD&C, as I combined physical prototyping with coding to improve the interaction level of the final design.

                                    This project investigates how design can better support romantic relationships impacted by dementia. Using a user-centred, research-for-design approach, it explores the lived experiences of both partners through interviews. The insights gained are used to identify opportunities for design and to propose guidelines that foster more loving environments.

                                    <li>I learned to conduct in-depth interviews about the very personal topics of love and loss by setting up and conducting semi-structured interviews with dementia patients and their partners. This developed my skills within U&S, as I created a comfortable atmosphere and ask open-minded questions that encourage participants to share deeply personal experiences.

                                    <br>
                                    <li>I became confident in interviewing and analysis by organising group coding sessions with ID researchers and PhD candidates in which we annotated transcripts, followed by a thematic analysis of the in-depth interview data. This strengthened my U&S and MD&C expertise, as I analysed long interviews and present the results in a story-based way that preserves participants’ lived experiences, an approach especially valuable for my personal design process.

This strengthened my U&S expertise, enabling me to draw on theory to more directly support users’ mental processes, which is valuable to me when working within wellbeing.

                                    Coco is a chatbot designed to support emerging adults during stressful life transitions by providing compassionate, judgment-free conversations. Coco combines journaling and self-reflection with AI-driven dialogue, creating a safe space for users to offload and reflect.

                                <p>
                                Throughout my FMP, I strengthened my ability to integrate user insights into my USD process, for both direction and validation, by conducting several semi-structured interviews with emerging adults. This improved both my U&C and MD&C  as these sessions focused on lived experiences, which I analysed through thematic analysis to identify patterns between participants. A clear example of applying user insights was in creating the visuals for Coco: this C&A process was grounded in feedback from users.

                                <p>
                                Alongside coding my portfolio website in HTML and embedding Coco with JavaScript, I expanded my T&R expertise by working with AI through Boost.ai. The platform allowed me to quickly work with LLMs and create a fully functional chatbot within one semester. By combining Boost.ai with a first-person perspective method, I was able to evaluate and reflect on conversation setups. This merged my C&A and T&R skills, as I utilised AI for a new creative method. Through my ERB process, I also learned to ask myself the right questions to design ethically with AI, resulting in Coco presenting as a non-replacement and using a platform with a DPI. This combined T&R with U&S as I learned to use AI responsibly, which is key for me when designing for well-being.

                                <p>
                                To increase the realism of my designs, I developed my B&E skills by conducting a business analysis of Coco, including its positioning, competitive landscape, and stakeholder value. This highlighted that customers and end users are not always the same, prompting me to think critically about the product’s ecosystem. This B&E analysis showed the connection with other expertise areas, as analysing stakeholder value helped highlight scalability(T&R) as an important value of AI to align the design with real-world needs(U&S).

                                <p>
                                During this project, I experienced stress-related mental health struggles, which motivated me to focus on well-being while actually accelerating my personal growth. As a perfectionist, progress can be difficult, but I learned to set priorities and deadlines, showing that my process works even when not every step is perfect. This improved my professional skills as it helped me manage challenges, cope with stress, and adapt when support was limited—for example, by actively seeking feedback from other coaches when my own was unavailable.

                                After my graduation I will work on my own mental health first. I value well-being both in my work and my own life but unfortunately this semester was mentally challenging. Therefore I will have a recharge phase that centralizes my own well-being, starting with a relaxing holiday. During this recharge phase, I will also start working more hours at my current job. Within this job, I can develop myself professionally without the challenges of having to start in a new environment immediately.

                                After this period, I will start to explore new opportunities that align more closely with my design vision. Looking ahead, I see myself working within a company setting since it fits my personality. I would love to be involved in projects related to well-being and mental health, but I am also open to other working fields where I can bring in my human-centred approach and focus on user needs.

                                Because of my dyslexia, AI in the form of ChatGPT was used to rewrite sentences to make them more legible and understandable. My written sentences often have grammar and spelling errors, making it difficult to understand. I used prompts like ''Can you tell me what sentences are grammatically incorrect and give me some replacement suggestions?'' to help me rewrite the first draft into the final version.
