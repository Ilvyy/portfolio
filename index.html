                            <h3>Identity</h3>
                            <p>
                                I am an empathetic and socio-sensitive designer with a focus on emotional well-being. I’ve always been a soft and socially sensitive person. Even as a child, I was deeply affected by the world around me, watching the news or seeing others in distress impacted me. To use empathy effectively and avoid its pitfalls, I use it as a starting point and combine it with real user input [1]. In my design, I think about my user, the user experience and social impact. My instinct in every situation is to help people. This shapes my vision on design in the sense that I care a lot about my user and their (emotional) well-being. This is something that I understood better throughout my master's. By choosing projects that matched my values, I discovered that well-being and mental support during difficult times are what my projects have had in common. I recently worked within themes like mental support in times of stress and supporting love in couples that are challenged with dementia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My values have led to an interest in Social Design, User Centred Design [6] and Design Thinking [7]. In my process, I focus on what really matters to me: understanding the user and their daily reality. Interviews and testing are important to make sure the design truly fits their needs. Within the design process, my strength lies in working on going from a rough sketch to a real concept by trying to find out what a user or society really needs. One thing I still find challenging is making fast decisions when the pace is high. Even though the master focused on solo projects, I believe in the strength of teamwork. Collaborative sessions with other designers or multidisciplinary teams add valuable perspectives. But something that is central for all my design projects is the user.

                            <h3>Vision</h3>
                            <p>
                                I believe that design should make the world a better place. I aim to create designs that truly help; designs that make people feel seen and empowered, even in life’s difficult moments. I believe this can be done by designing for well-being, which focuses on increasing happiness and empowering users to lead full lives [2].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               My motivation also comes from personal experiences. Going through periods of stress and caring for family members with health issues showed me how overwhelming and all-consuming these can be. These experiences made me realise how important it is to design for themes that are emotional, personal, and sometimes even taboo. Even though designing for well-being can be complex [5], I believe that including these themes is very meaningful because, for the person experiencing the struggle, it can deeply impact their daily life. Design can support and empower them by strengthening their mental well-being. Examples that inspires me as a designer are chatbots like Vincent [3] and Diarybot [4] which work on well-being with small daily interventions that help users become more mentally resilient.
                            </p>

                                I am a designer who looks at what technology fits the situation best. I use technology because of its potential within a project use case, not just for the sake of using it. In my approach, empathy and emotional depth are important. I focus on the mental and social layers of a person’s life, especially in moments of vulnerability. I bring this vision to life in two ways: by choosing projects that focus on emotionally relevant topics, and by actively integrating mental and emotional aspects throughout the design process. For me, it's important that the user is placed at the centre, not only in terms of usability, but as a whole person with emotional needs and lived experiences. I combine insights from proven concepts and literature with the perspective of the user within my design process. My design impacts society in terms of well-being. I hope to contribute to a world where design helps people not just function but truly thrive.

                                    During my master’s, I had a focus on the expertise area of User and Society, as it fits my vision closely. I developed my knowledge by taking courses like Design for Behavioural Change and User Experience Theory and Practice, which gave me methods for creating more user-centred designs. I also developed my user research skills, especially during my M1.2 project where I researched the needs of couples facing dementia. I conducted in-depth interviews and learned how to create a comfortable atmosphere and how to give off an open-minded impression. This helped participants open up about sensitive topics. I practiced setting up semi-structured interviews and learned to ask the right questions during an interview by balancing structure with follow-up questions. Later, in M2.1, I decided to take courses from the Human-Technology Interaction department. Here I learned about human decision-making and how environments shape behaviour. During these courses I discovered my interest in incorporating proven mental theories into design to elevate concepts in meaningful ways.

                                    In my FMP, I worked on a theme within emotional well-being. Therefore the project involved a complex and layered situation that required careful consideration of user experiences. I did this with a user-centred mindset, not only by empathizing with the users but also by repeatedly involving them directly in testing and interviews. In interviews I zoomed in on user experience as they were the most important to me. Experiences are especially important in the context of mental healthcare, where (emotional) responses can be varied. I found it fascinating to see how different participants interacted with the prototype and how much insight into usage those differences gave. Understanding the impact of the design in this way helped me grow as a designer and confirmed my passion for creating projects that supports well-being though user involvement.

                                <p>
                                    During my master’s, I followed several electives within the Business and Entrepreneurship expertise area as I wanted to become more ready for the world of business. These courses taught me to see entrepreneurship as a form of leadership, which I found inspiring. I discovered that I naturally have a coaching leadership style. Within teams I support others to thrive so the whole team can reach the best outcome. I also learned to see design thinking as a valuable tool for tackling business and organizational assignments. Even when the courses didn’t feel very businesslike, they helped me approach problems with a design mindset. This gave me more confidence in the usability of my designer skills. Alongside my studies, I also gained experience through my job at the R&D department of Lenco® (a sun shading company). Working in a company gave me insight into how businesses function and helped me realise that innovation is needed, even in smaller organisations.

                                    In my graduation project, I explored and analysed the business side of my design. I looked into the uniqueness of my concept through business positioning and competitive landscape analysis. From these, aspects of the design that would be most appealing to different stakeholders and customers were pinpointed. By considering how to bring this value to the user, a business plan was proposed. An important realization was that the customer of my design might not be the same as the end user. This helped me think more critically about the system around the product. Adding this business perspective gave the project another layer and made it feel more realistic and ready for real-world implementation, which is the value of Business and Entrepreneurship for me and my designs.

                                <p>
                                    When I started my master’s, I deliberately chose to follow the program part-time alongside my job. This job gave me valuable practical experience within Realisation. I gained hands-on skills in 3D modelling and 3D printing, which I appreciated as I didn’t always have time for that during my studies. I created 3D drawings for a few purposes: testing mechanical setups, printing mechanical parts for testing, and visualising outcomes for clients. I especially became skilled in drawing in SketchUp and rendering professional-looking visualisations. I really enjoy the freedom that skills within technology and realisation bring me; they make it possible to relatively quickly create interactive prototypes. In my M1.1 project, for example, we added an extra interaction layer to the design with an electrical wearable. Although it did not have a complicated circuit or code, it delivered a very interesting interaction that had not been possible otherwise.

                                <p>
                                    In my FMP, realisation and technology were present mainly in the development of the chatbot interaction. I enjoy combining social topics with new technologies, as they offer many opportunities. To use technologies like AI in a responsible way, it is important to think about how they are used. In my FMP, for example, I designed the bot not to be a human replacement. For this project, I chose to use Boost.ai as a platform, as it allowed me to quickly prototype with an already well-trained large language model in a time-efficient manner. This combination was important to me because I wanted to develop a fully experienceable prototype during a semester project. I also built this portfolio website using HTML. This experience helped me practice HTML and made it possible to embed Coco into a website using JavaScript.

                                <p>
                                    I found that I am more interested in the aesthetics of interaction than in traditional visual presentation.  I followed courses like Unexpected Material Engagements, which focused heavily on material exploration. Through this, I learned that a material-driven approach does not support my way of designing. I prefer to focus on what is needed in a situation, which means that starting from materials does not match my process. In my M1.1 project, I explored aesthetics of interaction in a different way. By experimenting with interpersonal contact using creative materials, such as a rope and balloons, different ways to start conversations were found. These methods sometimes felt a bit silly, but I did enjoy them as a creative starting point.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    In my FMP, I applied a few creative methods to help make my design more concrete. It was not always easy to move from a broad idea to a clear design, but methods like moodboarding, taking the first-person perspective, and using the Boost.ai prototype as a high-tech creative method helped me consider and experience different ideas. I also became more aware of how important visuals are when presenting a design. This is not only important for assessment but also for communication with users. Although visual presentation is not my strongest skill, I improved by setting aside time and actively taking steps. This helped me to express my ideas more clearly and with more confidence.

                                    There hasn’t been much math within my master's; for me, math data and computing mostly evolve around handling data. I learned a lot about processing and analysing qualitative data, which fits nicely with my interest in experience-based user research. In my M1.1 project, we conducted and coded a co-reflection session using ATLAS.ti. The results were presented in a structured and visual way. In contrast, my M1.2 research was presented more story-based. This project taught me a lot, as it was my first real research project focused on user needs. Through that experience, I became much more confident in interviewing and analysing. They are not only now among the parts of the design process I enjoy the most; I am also good at them.

                                    In my FMP, I conducted two user interviews that involved data handling. For the second one, I carried out a full thematic analysis based on deep, semi-structured interviews. I really liked this method as it helped me identify recurring themes while keeping the participants’ stories intact. The outcome wasn’t just useful for validation, but also served as grounded inspiration for the next phase of designing. Therefore, I plan to keep using this method in future projects. I also encountered some data privacy considerations during my ERB process. Since AI-based platforms involve large amounts of data, I learned more about how data is shared and how working with data processing agreements can help ensure privacy for my users. The use of these is something I will definitely carry with me into my professional career.

                                    During my master’s, a recurring goal for me was to become more confident in making rapid decisions. As a perfectionist, it can be difficult to move forward because there is always something that can be improved. By keeping a structured planning, I learned how to trust the process more. I also improved my networking and presenting skills. Testing my M1.1 project at the municipality of Brabant and recruiting participants at dementia-related events pushed me far outside of my comfort zone. This helped build my confidence and networking skills.
                                </p>

                                    During this project, especially during the first half of my FMP, I have struggled with some stress-related mental health struggles. This motivated me even more to work within well-being but also accelerated my personal learning goals. I had to set priorities and deadlines for myself as I was unable to make my usual number of hours in a week. This helped me prove to myself that my design process is still effective even though not every step is perfect. This way of working will surely stay in my wheelhouse as it helps me get better outcomes. This experience helped me as a professional as it taught me how to deal with challenges and stressful situations. This period also made me more aware of my own coping habits, and I feel better prepared to manage future difficulties. Involving others is also something that showed my professional skills. Since my mentor unfortunately was less present within my design process, I learned to adapt to this. I did this by proactively searching for others to discuss my project with, so, for example, other coaches were approached for feedback.

                                <p>
                                    During my master’s, I worked a lot on shaping my own design process. In my M1.1 project, there was a very interaction-centred approach, which I experienced as limiting. The strong focus on physical interaction left little time to explore other aspects of the design that I found important. My M1.2 project centred around understanding user needs, which I really enjoyed. But I did discover that prioritising this too much created its own challenges. Both of these projects helped me develop a more balanced design approach where there is room for multiple important elements.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    In my FMP, I tried to apply my new attitude. This worked generally well. I followed a structured and iterative design process. Still, I found it difficult at times to make the right decisions at the right moment. Each phase brings new considerations, and choosing what to prioritise was challenging. In hindsight, I see that some things could have been improved, such as including customer needs earlier in the process. I believe I will continue learning more about how to prioritise better and to adapt my method to future clients. During my FMP, I also learned to stay flexible in the process. An example of this was using a first-person perspective when the opportunity came up during the semester.

                                After my graduation I will work on my own mental health first. I value well-being both in my work and my own life but unfortunately this semester was mentally challenging. Therefore I will have a recharge phase that centralizes my own well-being, starting with a relaxing holiday. During this recharge phase, I will also start working more hours at my current job. Within this job, I can develop myself professionally without the challenges of having to start in a new environment immediately.

                                After this period, I will start to explore new opportunities that align more closely with my design vision. Looking ahead, I see myself working within a company setting since it fits my personality. I would love to be involved in projects related to well-being and mental health, but I am also open to other working fields where I can bring in my human-centred approach and focus on user needs.

                                Because of my dyslexia, AI in the form of ChatGPT was used to rewrite sentences to make them more legible and understandable. My written sentences often have grammar and spelling errors, making it difficult to understand. I used prompts like ''Can you tell me what sentences are grammatically incorrect and give me some replacement suggestions?'' to help me rewrite the first draft into the final version.
