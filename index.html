                            <p>
                                I am an empathetic and socio-sensitive designer with a focus on emotional wellbeing. I’ve always been a soft and socially sensitive person. Even as a child, I was deeply affected by the world around me, watching the news or seeing others in distress impacted me. This makes me good at seeing things from another’s perspective which gives useful insights. In my design, I think about my user, the user experience and social impact a lot. My instinct in every situation is to help people. This shapes my vision on design in the sense that I care a lot about my user and their (emotional) well-being. This is something that I understood better throughout my master's. By choosing projects that matched my values, I discovered that well-being and mental support during difficult times are what my projects have had in common. I recently worked within themes like mental support in times of stress and supporting love in couples that are challenged with dementia. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have an interest in Social Design, User Centred Design and Design Thinking. In my process, I focus on what really matters to me: understanding the user and their daily reality. Interviews and testing are important to make sure the design truly fits their needs. During my master’s, I focused on improving my professional skills and shaping my own way of working. Within the design process, my strength lies in working on going from a rough sketch to a real concept by trying to find out what a user or society really needs. One thing I still find challenging is making fast decisions when the pace is high. Even though the master was mostly focused on solo project, I believe in the strength of teamwork. Working in multidisciplinary teams or having standalone collaborative sessions with other designers brings valuable perspectives to a project. Still, I believe the most important collaboration is with users.

                            <h3>Vision</h3>
                            <p>
                                I believe that design should make the world a better place, which can be done by improving mental well-being and happiness. I aim to create designs that truly help; designs that make people feel seen and empowered, even in life’s difficult moments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               My motivation also comes from personal experiences. Going through periods of stress, or caring for family members with health issues, showed me how overwhelming and all-consuming these can be. These experiences made me realise how important it is to design for themes that are emotional, personal, and sometimes even taboo. Even though this can be complex, I believe designing for these themes is very meaningful because for the person experiencing the struggle, it can deeply impact their daily life. Design can support and empower them by strengthening their mental well-being.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am a designer who looks at what technology fits the situation best. I use technology because of its potential within a project use case, not just for the sake of using it. In my approach, empathy and emotional depth are important. I focus on the mental and social layers of a person’s life, especially in moments of vulnerability. I bring this vision to life in two ways: by choosing projects that focus on emotionally relevant topics, and by actively integrating mental and emotional aspects throughout the design process. For me, it's important that the user is placed at the centre, not only in terms of usability, but as a whole person with emotional needs and lived experiences.   I combine insights from proven concepts and literature with the perspective of the user within my design process. My design impact society in terms of wellbeing. I hope to contribute to a world where design helps people not just function but truly thrive.

                                <p>
                                    During my master’s, I had a focus on the expertise area of User and Society, as it fits my vision closely. I developed my knowledge by taking courses like Design for Behavioural Change and User Experience Theory and Practice, which gave me methods for creating more user-centred designs.  I also developed my user research skills, especially during my M1.2 project where I researched the needs of couples facing dementia.  I conducted in-depth interviews and learned how to create a comfortable atmosphere and how to give op an open-minded impression. This helped participants open up about sensitive topics. I practiced setting up semi-structured interviews and learned to ask the right questions during an interview by balancing structure with follow-up questions. Later, in M2.1, I decided to take courses from the Human-Technology Interaction department. Here I learned about human decision-making and how environments shape behaviour. During these courses I discovered my interest in incorporating proven mental theories into design to elevate concepts in meaningful ways.

                                <p>
                                    In my FMP, I worked on a theme within emotional well-being, Therefore the project involved a complex and layered situation that required careful consideration of user experiences. I did this with a user-cantered mindset, not only by empathizing with the users but also by repetitively involving them directly in testing and interviews. In interviews I zoomed in on users experience as they were the most important to me. Experiences are especially important in the context of mental healthcare, where (emotional) responses can very varied. I found it fascinating to see how different participants interacted with the prototype and how much insight into usage those differences gave. Understanding the impact of the design in this way helped me grow as a designer and confirmed my passion for creating projects that supports well-being though user involvement.

                                After my graduation I will work on my own mental health first. I value well-being both in my work and my own life but unfortunately this semester was mentally challenging. Therefore I will have a recharge phase that centralizes my own wellbeing, starting with a relaxing holiday. During this recharge phase, I will also start working more hours at my current job. Within this job, I can develop myself professionally without the challenges of having to start in a new environment immediately. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                After this period, I will start to explore new opportunities that align more closely with my design vision. Looking ahead, I see myself working within a company setting since it fits my personality. I would love to be involved in projects related to well-being and mental health, but I am also open to other working fields where I can bring in my human-centred approach and focus on user needs.

                                Because of my dyslexia, AI in the form of ChatGPT was used to rewrite sentences to make them more legible and understandable. My written sentences often have grammar and spelling errors, making it difficult to understand. I used prompts like ''Can you tell me what sentences are grammatically incorrect and give me some replacement suggestions?'' to help me rewrite the first draft into the final version.

                                AI was also used in the development of the prototype Coco, an AI chatbot.
