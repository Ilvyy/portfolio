                            <h3>Identity</h3>
                            <p>
                                I am an empathetic and socio-sensitive designer with a focus on emotional well-being. I’ve always been a soft and socially sensitive person. Even as a child, I was deeply affected by the world around me, watching the news or seeing others in distress impacted me. To use empathy effectively and avoid its pitfalls, I use it as a starting point and combine it with real user input [1]. In my design, I think about my user, the user experience and social impact. My instinct in every situation is to help people. This shapes my vision on design in the sense that I care a lot about my user and their (emotional) well-being. This is something that I understood better throughout my master's. By choosing projects that matched my values, I discovered that well-being and mental support during difficult times are what my projects have had in common. I recently worked within themes like mental support in times of stress and supporting love in couples that are challenged with dementia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My values have led to an interest in Social Design, User Centred Design [6] and Design Thinking [7]. In my process, I focus on what really matters to me: understanding the user and their daily reality. Interviews and testing are important to make sure the design truly fits their needs. Within the design process, my strength lies in working on going from a rough sketch to a real concept by trying to find out what a user or society really needs. One thing I still find challenging is making fast decisions when the pace is high. Even though the master focused on solo projects, I believe in the strength of teamwork. Collaborative sessions with other designers or multidisciplinary teams add valuable perspectives. But something that is central for all my design projects is the user.

                            <h3>Vision</h3>
                            <p>
                                I believe that design should make the world a better place. I aim to create designs that truly help; designs that make people feel seen and empowered, even in life’s difficult moments. I believe this can be done by designing for well-being, which focuses on increasing happiness and empowering users to lead full lives [2].
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               My motivation also comes from personal experiences. Going through periods of stress and caring for family members with health issues showed me how overwhelming and all-consuming these can be. These experiences made me realise how important it is to design for themes that are emotional, personal, and sometimes even taboo. Even though designing for well-being can be complex [5], I believe that including these themes is very meaningful because, for the person experiencing the struggle, it can deeply impact their daily life. Design can support and empower them by strengthening their mental well-being. Examples that inspires me as a designer are chatbots like Vincent [3] and Diarybot [4] which work on well-being with small daily interventions that help users become more mentally resilient.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am a designer who looks at what technology fits the situation best. I use technology because of its potential within a project use case, not just for the sake of using it. In my approach, empathy and emotional depth are important. I focus on the mental and social layers of a person’s life, especially in moments of vulnerability. I bring this vision to life in two ways: by choosing projects that focus on emotionally relevant topics, and by actively integrating mental and emotional aspects throughout the design process. For me, it's important that the user is placed at the centre, not only in terms of usability, but as a whole person with emotional needs and lived experiences. I combine insights from proven concepts and literature with the perspective of the user within my design process. My design impacts society in terms of well-being. I hope to contribute to a world where design helps people not just function but truly thrive.

                                This chapter is structured around my development and created strengths. I begin with U&S, where I consider myself highly skilled, followed by B&E and T&R, areas in which I have learned a lot and see strong value. Finally, I reflect on C&A and MD&C, which I regard as more supportive areas where my skills are less developed but still contribute to my design process.

                                    This is my strongest and favorite expertise area, <a href="#m1.2" onclick="gotoItem('portfolio','m1.2')">test link to fmp</a> as it is closely connected to my PIV. I have developed the ability to place the user at the center of my design process (USD) while also critically analyzing the broader societal impact of my wellbeing designs. I am experienced in conducting in-depth interviews in search of user needs and situated perspectives, and I can work with qualitative data at a research level.

                                    B&E is the expertise area where I have grown the most. While I am not yet an expert, I have gained valuable knowledge and become confident in applying Design Thinking to a wide range of problem statements, which has strengthened both my design process and my professional development. Additionally, I can apply various models, such as the Business Model Canvas, Stakeholder Tension Mapping, and PESTEL analysis, to critically analyse and strengthen my designs, making them more relevant and ready for real-world application.

                                    My skills within T&R are at beginner level, but I am able to apply them broadly in practical contexts. For me, this area is about building hands-on skills that enable me to independently create and test my ideas. I have programmed a website, integrated a conversational agent, and developed code for an electronic wearable, which strengthened my coding abilities. While my programming knowledge is not yet advanced, it enables me to quickly prototype interactive concepts. In addition, I am proficient in 3D modelling and rendering (SketchUp, Enscape, SolidWorks) and use 3D printing in my design process, a skill enhanced through my part-time job.

                                    I consider my skills in C&A to be at a medium level. Creativity, to me, is not just about methods but also about the attitude I have developed, one of openness and resourcefulness. I apply creative methods throughout my projects, for example, using first-person perspective techniques or employing a chatbot as a tool for ideation and fine-tuning in my FMP. While I am not particularly strong in traditional visual presentation, I am especially interested in the aesthetics of interaction. For example, I am able to use material-driven aesthetics of interaction techniques, particularly during the ideation and early design phases.

                                    My skills within MD&C are overall limited, but there is one specific aspect that I find highly valuable for my vision and design process: working with qualitative data. Through my M1.1, M2.1, and FMP projects, I got a lot experience in analysing interview and user test data. I am capable of conducting (group) coding sessions and performing thematic analyses, which I use to ground my designs in rich user insights.

                                    The Social Progress Index measures the success of a region based on social progress rather than economic performance. Entangled Conversations enriches this tool using personal storytelling, visualization, and embodied activities to reveal individual perspectives and foster connections.

                                    I choose this project within the TP squad as I wanted to learn to deal with complexity. This was important to me as my identity is about working with stakeholders and estimating impact on society.

                                    <li>I learned to use <b>ethnographic research</b> within ideation. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>I explored <b>aesthetics of interaction</b> in a new way to extend my C&A skills. By experimenting with interpersonal contact using creative materials, different ways to start conversations were found. Although, these methods sometimes felt a bit silly, I made them my own as a creative brainstorming method.

                                    <li>An electrical wearable, was created, improving my T&R skills. Although it was not complicated, it delivered a very interesting interaction. This learned me the freedom that skills within technology and realisation bring me; they make it possible to relatively quickly create interactive prototypes.

                                    This project investigates how design can better support romantic relationships impacted by dementia. Using a <b>user-cantered</b>, <b>research-for-design</b> approach, it explores the lived experiences of both partners through interviews. The insights gained are used to identify opportunities for design and to propose guidelines that foster more loving environments.

                                    <li>I conducted in-depth interviews and learned how to create a comfortable atmosphere and how to give off an open-minded impression. This helped participants open up about sensitive topics. I practiced setting up <b>semi-structured interviews</b> and learned to ask the right questions during an interview by balancing structure with follow-up questions. User interviews are not only now among the parts of the design process I enjoy the most; I am also good at them, lifting my U&S skills to a higher level.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Through this project, I learned a lot within MD&C, as it was my first real research project focused on user needs. I became much more confident in interviewing and analysing (<b>Thematic analysis</b>) as I learned to present research story-based.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>I improved my paper/report writing skills

                                    <li>Through the recruitment process of participants, which involved attending dementia related events and having hands on experience at a community centre, I gained more confidence in my role as a visiting designer.

                                    <li>Even when the courses didn’t feel very businesslike, they helped me approach problems with a design mindset. This gave me more confidence in the usability of my designer skills. I now see entrepreneurship as a form of leadership, improving my insights into B&E. I discovered that I naturally have a coaching leadership style; within teams I support others to thrive so the whole team can reach the best outcome. I also learned to see design thinking as a valuable tool for tackling business and organizational assignments.

I created 3D drawings in <b>Sketchup</b> and <b>SolidWorks</b> for a few purposes: testing mechanical setups, printing mechanical parts for testing, and visualising outcomes for clients. I learned to use 3d printing during the design and realisation process. And I especially became skilled in drawing in SketchUp and rendering professional-looking visualisations in <b>Enscape</b>.

                                In my FMP, I applied proven mental theories as I set out to do after my M2.1. I worked on emotional well-being, a complex theme that required a strong user-centred approach. I empathised with users and involved them directly through testing and interviews, focusing on their experiences as the most valuable input. In mental healthcare, responses can vary widely, and I found it fascinating to see how different participants engaged with the prototype. This helped me grow as a designer and strengthened my passion for creating projects that support well-being through user involvement.

                                I explored the business side of my design by analysing its positioning and competitive landscape. This revealed which aspects appealed most to stakeholders and led to a business plan for implementation. An important insight was that customers and end users are not always the same, which made me think more critically about the product’s ecosystem. Adding this perspective made the project feel more realistic and ready for real-world use.

                                T&R was mainly present during the development of the chatbot interaction. I enjoy combining social topics with new technologies like AI. To do this in a responsible way, I analysed intended usage and designed the bot to complement rather than replace humans. Using Boost.ai for this allowed me to quickly prototype a fully experienceable concept within one semester. In addition, I built this portfolio website in HTML and embedded the chatbot with JavaScript, which helped me practice my technical skills.

                                Going from a broad idea to a clear design was sometimes challenging, but developing my own creative methods helped. For example, I created first-person sessions in which I analysed conversations prototyped in Boost.ai from my own perspective. I also became more aware of the importance of visuals, both for assessment and communication with users. Visual presentation is not my strongest skill, but I improved by setting aside time to practice, which allowed me to express ideas more clearly and with greater confidence.

                                I conducted semi-structured interviews and carried out a thematic analysis, which helped me identify recurring themes while keeping participants’ stories. This method not only validated my design but also inspired further development; therefore I plan to use it again in my future. I also learned about data privacy through the ERB process, particularly regarding AI platforms and data agreements, which I will carry forward into my professional career.

                                After my graduation I will work on my own mental health first. I value well-being both in my work and my own life but unfortunately this semester was mentally challenging. Therefore I will have a recharge phase that centralizes my own well-being, starting with a relaxing holiday. During this recharge phase, I will also start working more hours at my current job. Within this job, I can develop myself professionally without the challenges of having to start in a new environment immediately.

Looking ahead, I see myself working within a company setting since it fits my personality. I would love to be involved in projects related to well-being and mental health, but I am also open to other working fields where I can bring in my human-centred approach and focus on user needs.

                                Because of my dyslexia, AI in the form of ChatGPT was used to rewrite sentences to make them more legible and understandable. My written sentences often have grammar and spelling errors, making it difficult to understand. I used prompts like ''Can you tell me what sentences are grammatically incorrect and give me some replacement suggestions?'' to help me rewrite the first draft into the final version.
